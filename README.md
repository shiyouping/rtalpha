## **1. Introduction**
This open source project intends to create an online travel platform where travel agencies sell their products and services, and customers compare prices of similar products and services from different agencies in one stop. This platform is similar to [Wing On Travel](https://www.wingontravel.com/) in Hong Kong, and is not exclusive to one or only a few companies, but open to any travel agencies to do their B2C business like [Taobao](https://www.taobao.com/) in China. I initiated this project with a hope that people in Hong Kong who like travelling will have one online portal where they can choose best travel products and services, seek travel advice, make friends with peers who love travelling too, etc. This project was originally hosted at Amazon Web Service, and just moved from there to GitHub for open source.

## **2. Project Modules**
This project has following three modules:

 **2.1. [Server Module](https://github.com/shiyouping/rtalpha/tree/master/server)** <br>
 A set of server applications, which are micro-service based, to provide back end services to web and mobile modules. Server module is already under development.
 
 **2.2. [Web Module](https://github.com/shiyouping/rtalpha/tree/master/web)** <br>
 A web application to provide an online portal to this travel platform. The development of this module hasn't started due to resource shortage.
 
 **2.3. [Mobile Module](https://github.com/shiyouping/rtalpha/tree/master/mobile)** <br>
 Android and iOS apps for mobile users. The development of this module hasn't started due to resource shortage.

## **3. Contributors**
Currently, I am the only contributor of this project, and have been focusing on the server side development since the beginning. As a software engineer, I have my own full-time job and can only work on this project on the weekends or after work. Therefore, the development is slow. I need more people to join me, especially web and mobile app developers. Any people who are interested are welcome to contribute. You can reach me at ricky.shiyouping@gmail.com.
